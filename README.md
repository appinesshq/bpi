## About The Project

The BPI project is the open source infrastructure serving [doing business in europe](https://doingbusinessineurope.com) and [global business guide](https://globalbusinessguide.net). The purpose of the project is to create a community based interactive platform for knowledge sharing about doing business in and beyond Europe. The platform functions as a knowledge base and network for entrepreneurs and service providers.

This repo provides the backend and web frontend as a monorepo for all code using Go. The mobile clients will get their own repo.

Please read the project wiki (WIP).
