## About The Project

The BPI project is the open source infrastructure serving doingbusinessineurope.com and -eventually- the global version at globalbusinessguide.com. The project's purpose is to serve as a community based knowledge base and networking tool for internationally oriented entrepreneurs and professional service providers.

This repo is a monorepo for all Go related code, currently consisting of:
- The backend instrastructure
- The UI (web frontend) infrastructure
- The admin CLI

The mobile clients will get their own repo, as they will not be developed in Go.

Please read the project wiki (Comming Soon)
